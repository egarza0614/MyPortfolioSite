# Challenge2: Portfolio | Eloy Garza

## Description

Professional portfolio for Eloy Garza, providing career details, web development examples, and contact information. Project is an HTML/CSS webpage.

## Usage

The link to my deployed github portfolio is: https://egarza0614.github.io/MyPortfolioSite

My portfolio contains a navigation bar which will smooth scroll to the relevant section of the page once a link is clicked. The links in the navigation bar also change colour when the cursor hovers over them.

The "My Work" section will eventually contain links to my completed projects, but for now they are placeholders! Each application link is an image with a title overlay which appears when the cursor hovers over the image.

The "Contact Me" section contains 3 active links to contact me via email, connect with me via linkedin or view my github profile.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance:
